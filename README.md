# Cooked 🍳
An intuitive inventory management system designed for small businesses and solo entrepreneurs to track stock, sales, and performance with ease.

Cooked is a web-based inventory management system that helps small business owners and solo entrepreneurs stay on top of their inventory, sales, and reporting. Whether you sell products online, in person, or both. Cooked simplifies the way you manage your operations.

This project was born out of the need for a lightweight, user-friendly alternative to bloated inventory systems. It prioritizes clarity, customization, and speed, allowing users to focus more on selling and less on logistics.
